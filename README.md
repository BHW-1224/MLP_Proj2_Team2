# MLP_Proj2_Team2

## Step-1


## Step-2


## Step-3
Train the model by running training_model.py in the Training_code_for_step3 folder (you can also use the vader-model.pkl file in the same directory).
The model will be saved in the same directory as my_trained_best_model. Upload these model files to Kaggle and assign that directory to the "SAVED_MODEL_PATH" value.
On Kaggle, use the "mlp-proj2-step3.ipynb" code from the Kaggle Notebooks folder. In the input settings, select LLM Classification Finetuning for the competition and debertav3large for the datasets. Upload the resulting files and the vader-model file in GitHub, and run it with the correct PATH to reproduce the model.
